          The event was a success, and we realized good ideas can <br />
          come from anyone, anywhere, at any time. They also <br /> realized
          there were many others who wanted to support <br /> good ideas. So
          they left the Bank to launch the worldâ€™s first <br /> crowdfunding
          community in 2002. Today, people in more <br /> than 165 countries can
          easily share their ideas, and <br />
          individual donors and companies can easily support vetted <br />{" "}
          nonprofits.
